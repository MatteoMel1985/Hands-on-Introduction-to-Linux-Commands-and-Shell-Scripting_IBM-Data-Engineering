# ETL Daily Weather Forecast

## Scenario  

You've been tasked by your team to create an automated Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to extract daily weather forecast and observed weather data and load it into a live report to be used for further analysis by the analytics team. As part of a larger prediction modelling project, the team wants to use the report to monitor and measure the historical accuracy of temperature forecasts by source and station.

As a proof-of-concept (POC), you are only required to do this for a single station and one source to begin with. For each day at noon (local time), you will gather both the actual temperature and the temperature forecasted for noon on the following day for Casablanca, Morocco.

At a later stage, the team anticipates extending the report to include lists of locations, different forecasting sources, different update frequencies, and other weather metrics such as wind speed and direction, precipitation, and visibility.

At a later stage, the team plans to expand the report to include lists of locations, different forecast sources, different update frequencies, and other weather parameters such as wind speed and direction, precipitation, and visibility.

## Data Source
For this practice project, you'll use the weather data package provided by the open source project [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/), a web service that provides weather forecast information in a simple and text-based format. For further information, you can read more about the service on its GitHub Repo.

First, you'll use the `curl` command to scrape weather data via the wttr.in website. For example, to get data for Casablanca, enter:  

```bash
curl wttr.in/casablanca
```  
which prints the following to `stdout`:

## Additional Information
- ``rx_poc.log`` : POC weather report log file (text file containing a growing history of the daily weather data to be scraped).
- ``rx_poc.sh``  : Bash script of the weather report from wttr.in.
- ``weather_report``    : The weather report generated by running the file `rx_poc.sh`.

Finally, we scheduled the Bash script `rx_poc.sh` to run every day at midnight local time with cron.
